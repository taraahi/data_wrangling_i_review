```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```
We're focusing on the `readr` package. 

```{r}
getwd()
```

## Read in some data

We want to use a relative path, not an absolute path.

Read in the litters dataset.

```{r}
litters_df = read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)
```


## Take a look at the data

Printing in the console.
```{r}
litters_df
```

It's telling us we have 49 rows and 8 columns, it's a tibble, variable names have been converted to snakecase compared to before. 


Beginning or end of dataset:
```{r}
head(litters_df)
tail(litters_df)
```

Summary tool:
```{r}
skimr::skim(litters_df)
```


Can type `view` in the CONSOLE. It opens up another window to see full dataset.
